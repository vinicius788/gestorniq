# Working agreements

- Language consistency: UI copy must be English-only (EN).
- Spacing scale: use `4/8/12/16/24/32/48` for layout and component spacing.
- Theme tokens: keep color and typography tokens centralized in one place.
- Reuse first: prefer shared UI components over duplicated page markup.
- Release quality: run `lint` and `build` before finalizing UI changes.
